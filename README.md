There is one R script with one R function for carrying out the transformations required as part of the Getting and Cleaning Data assignment from Coursera.

The R file is run_analysis.R, with one function 'run_analysis'. It needs to be placed in the same folder as where the UCI HAR Dataset is placed. It also includes the one library required as part of the execution, so no additional libraries need to be included separately.

The script writes the final tidy data set file to the UCI HAR Dataset folder.
